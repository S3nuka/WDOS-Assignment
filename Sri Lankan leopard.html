            <h1>Sri Lankan Leopard</h1>
            <p>The Leopard (Panthera pardus, Linnaeus, 1758) is the most secretive and elusive of the large carnivores,
                and also the shrewdest. Pound for pound, it is the strongest climber of the larger cats and is capable
                of killing prey far larger than itself. However, the leopard is the smallest member of the genus Panthera,
                which includes the Lion, Tiger and Jaguar. Historically, the leopard had a wide distribution across eastern
                and southern Asia and Africa, from Siberia to South Africa, with fragmented populations in the Indian subcontinent,
                Sri Lanka, Indochina, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. Sadly, the range has decreased radically due to over hunting
                and loss of habitat.</p>

                        <h3>Yala National Park</h3>
                        <p>Yala National Park is known as the best place to spot leopards in Sri Lanka.
                            This is because Yala has the highest density of leopards of anywhere on the island.
                            However, this statistic means that the park often has a high density of tourists too,
                            especially in the peak season from December to March.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            However, with five different zones to be explored, it is possible to
                            find quiet corners of the park. In addition to its rugged coastline,
                            Yala is comprised of dry grass fields, arid scrubland, and pockets
                            of jungle. Other animals that call this park home include elephants,
                            sloth bears, and crocodiles

                        <h3>Kumana National Park</h3>
                        <p>Neighbour to Yala, Kumana National Park is a smaller but more tranquil 
                            option for those seeking to spot leopards without the crowds.
                            Sightings are rare here, but the scenery is just as stunning.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This park is primarily a bird sanctuary, its sprawling mangrove lagoon
                            providing a perfect nesting ground for many migrating species. Visit
                            in May and June to see eye-catching water birds such as painted storks,
                            herons, egrets and pelicans

                            In the opposite corner of the country to Yala is sensational Wilpattu
                            National Park. This is the largest and most beautiful wildlife reserve
                            in Sri Lanka. Despite being the biggest wildlife park, Wilpattu's
                            remote north-west position means that it is away from the main
                            tourist trail and is therefore much quieter than Yala in terms
                            of tourist numbers. Covered by a network of interlaced lakes, 
                            this jungle-rich park hides leopards in the undergrowth as
                            well as sloth bears and endless species of bird.
